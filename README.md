# Crowdfunding-ETL
The company has just received a new dataset that contains information about the backers who’ve pledged to the live projects. And, Independent Funding wants you and Britta to perform both an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.

# Challenge:
 We used Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, we extracted and transformed the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. Specifically, we use the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. And, we uploaded the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, we performed a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
